                    For marketing purposes only, we have several versions of our
                    business online under various domain names. Each domain name
                    will have a link to our parent website. All transactions are
                    performed under our legal name, Raptor Media, LLC.

                    RaptorMedia with and without any extension is owned by
                    Raptor Media, LLC and governed by disclaimers posted at
                    RaptorMedia and RaptorMedia.co and various RaptorMedia
                    extensions. Referencing any terms under any of our domains
                    is therefore referencing Raptor Media, LLC. At RaptorMedia
                    we work very hard to bring quality designs at affordable
                    prices to help promote small businesses. The unique system
                    implemented by RaptorMedia creates a vested financial
                    interest with each client as our profits are spread long
                    term. This relationship benefits the client with lower entry
                    costs and superior long term support. Our clients have opted
                    for hands-off service. These services are not operated with
                    control panels that are capable of granting permissions and
                    monitor backend users. These terms apply to all of our work
                    under all of our public domains. To protect our investment
                    with each client, RaptorMedia has implemented some measures.
